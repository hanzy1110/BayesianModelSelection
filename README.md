# BayesianModelSelection
Bayesian model selection for Oxidation Kinetics modelling
Install requirements in a python enviroment using pip install -r requirements.txt

Milestones:
- Implemented Inference for diferent models
- Posterior Predictive plots for every model
- Results in the IPython Notebook!

TODO:
- Compute Bayes factor for every model
- Perform model Selection
- Use WAIC or other methodology?
